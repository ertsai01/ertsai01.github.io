                                    I'm always striving to stay curious and inspired, and 
                                    am always looking for opportunities to fill my toolkit.

                                    anything in between!

                                    Since I was little, I loved to create. From video-editing and drawing to music and dance,
                                    I used any medium I could get my hands on to convey my visions and the beauty in the world around me.
                                    Whether it be school projects or my own endeavors,
                                    I strove to express my individuality and push the boundaries of my imagination at every opportunity.
                                    Over time, I gained a profound interest in human interaction and psychology.
                                    I began exploring both CS and cognitive science my freshman year of college, 
                                    and have since developed an interest in UI/UX design and web development. 
                                    I am currently a software development intern at FairX, and can't wait to see where my journey will take me!

                                    Music is one of my greatest passions, and I‚Äôve dreamt about composing my own music for as long as I can remember. 
                                    While I'm still expanding my skills, playing and learning more about music is one of my favorite pasttimes!

                                    When I'm not on my laptop or keyboard, I love dancing, doodling, 
                                    scouting out new cafes, and watching food videos.
